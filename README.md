## 1. Project structure and File Summary

This zip file contains all components requires to reproduce the data peocessing workflow, she shiny dashboard, and visualization included in final submission.

---
### **A. Shiny Application**

- **app.R**

    The main Shiny application file. It contains the full UI layout, server logic, reactive filtering and all visualization code.

- **dashboard.png**
    
    A screenshot of the final dashboard.

- **rsconnect/**

    Auto generated folder containing deployment matadata for shinyapps.io

---
### **B. Processed Data Files (or for convinence, can be used directly by Shiny)**

These files are preprocessed datasets generated by running 'proj.R'. The Shiny app reads these 'rds' files directly.

- `daily_trend_all.rds`: Total tap on counts per weekday for each snapshot.
- `daily_trend_by_mode.rds`:Weekday tap on trends by transport mode.
- `hourly_heatmap.rds`: Hourly tap activity for each snapshot and mode.
- `mode_pie_on.rds`: Tap on counts by transport mode.
- `summary_box.rds`: Snapshot level tap on tap off total.
- `sydney_map1.rds`: Dataframe version of Sydney Travel Zone polygons

- `time_24aug.csv`  
- `time_24feb.csv`  
    Time-level tap events for each snapshot.

- `tsn-to-tz-mapping.csv`

- `tsydney_map.rds`  
    Intermediate spatial object.

### **E. Instructions for accessing or using the final product**

### **a. Running locally**
1. Running `proj.R`. This script reproduces all files in Section B.
2. run the app
```r
shiny::runApp('app.R')
```

### **b. Online dashboard**
The final interactive dashboard is deployed at: https://devinma.shinyapps.io/project/
